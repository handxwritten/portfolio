  </header>
    <main><i>Hello! I'm Austin, Pleasure to meet you!</i></main>
      <p><br>I was born and raised in a very small town outside Salt Lake City, UT. I made the move up to Seattle in 2015
         <br>for more opportunity career wise and have found myself repairing A/V equipment on Microsoft campus.
         <br>I fall more and more in love with this city every year! I've recently been exploring the mountains and water we're surrounded with.
         <br>In my free time I enjoy long distance running, playing PC games, and reading any decent book I can get my hands on.</p>
        <p>It's been quite a year for me, in 2019 so far I've accomplished quite a few personal goals!!</p>
          <ol>
            <li>I ran my first marathon on June 9th, the Rock n Roll marathon in Seattle, what an experience!</li>
            <li>I am marrying my best friend Kyrie at the end of July!</li>
            <li>Lastly, I've taken steps in furthering my career by signing up for this UW certification program.</li>
          </ol>
